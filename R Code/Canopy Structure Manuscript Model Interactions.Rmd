# OVERVIEW

## Questions

- **(1)** Does regular exposure to non-hurricane winds reduce canopy structural complexity in tropical forests?  
- **(2)** To what extent is this effect mediated by climate, topography, substrate, forest age and past disturbances?

## Goals

This script checks for Random Forest (RF) model interactions between predictors of:     
      - **(1)** Canopy Height
      - **(2)** Canopy Top Rugosity (sd of height along moving windows) - Vertical variation for top of canopy  
      
      
The predictors are:    
      - Soil type and soil water availability
      - Forest age  
      - Wind exposure (calculated with prevalent directions and using a 30m DEM)
      - Elevation mean and range (30m USGS DEM)
      - Slope (30m USGS DEM)
      - Long term mean annual precipitation 1963-1995 (PRISM)
      - Past exposure to hurricane Hugo in 1989 and hurricane Georges in 1998 (Boose et al., 2004)

## Data

The LiDAR data come from 2016 flights by the USGS, which were then normalized by Lora Murphy of the Cary Institute.
Lora also calculated a canopy height model (CHM) and top rugosity.

Study sites were selected by stratified sampling randomly across forest age,
Then creating a required 250m minimum distance between points,
Then creating 30m buffers around to have a scale that captures a forest stand,
Then filtering out non-forest points if they contain non-forest elements within the buffer.

This resulted in 20,660 study sites across Puerto Rico for the 30m buffer.
